This is a pure Lua library for detecting access to uninitialized
variables from [Lua][] 5.1 (including [LuaJIT][]), 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4.  The libraries
are copyright by their authors (see the [AUTHORS][] file for details),
and released under the [MIT license][mit] (the same license as Lua
itself).  There is no warranty.

When using this module, all variables (including functions!) must be 
declared through a regular assignment (even assigning `nil` will do) in a
strict scope before being used anywhere or assigned to inside a nested
scope.

Installation
------------

The simplest and best way to install strict is with [LuaRocks][]. To
install the latest release (recommended):

```bash
    luarocks install std.strict
```

To install current git master (for testing, before submitting a bug
report for example):

```bash
    luarocks install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lua-stdlib/strict/master/std.strict-git-1.rockspec
```

The best way to install without [LuaRocks][] is to copy the
`std/strict` directory into your package search path.

Use
---

The strict package returns a callable, which when called returns a
strict environment table that requires all variables be declared before
use. For compatibility with Lua > 5.1, you must assign this environment
table to `_ENV`; if necessary, `setfenv` will be called automatically
for compatibility with Lua 5.1 and LuaJIT.

```lua
   -- For example, use of the global environment from this scope.
   local _ENV = require 'std.strict' (_G)

   -- Or, prevent all access to global environment.
   local _ENV = require 'std.strict' {}

   -- Or, control access to limited environment from this scope.
   local _ENV = require 'std.strict' {
      setmetatable = setmetatable,
      type = type,
      table_unpack = table.unpack or unpack,
   }
```



Documentation

The latest release is [documented with LDoc][github.io].
Pre-built HTML files are included in the [release tarball][release].

Bug reports and code contributions
----------------------------------

This library is written and maintained by its users.

Please make bug reports and suggestions as [GitHub Issues][issues].
Pull requests are especially appreciated.

But first, please check that your issue has not already been reported by
someone else, and that it is not already fixed by [master][github] in
preparation for the next release (see Installation section above for how
to temporarily install master with [LuaRocks][]).

There is no strict coding style, but please bear in mind the following
points when proposing changes:

0. Follow existing code. There are a lot of useful patterns and avoided
   traps there.

1. 3-character indentation using SPACES in Lua sources: It makes rogue
   TABs easier to see, and lines up nicely with 'if' and 'end' keywords.

2. Simple strings are easiest to type using single-quote delimiters,
   saving double-quotes for where a string contains apostrophes.

3. Save horizontal space by only using SPACES where the parser requires
   them.

4. Use vertical space to separate out compound statements to help the
   coverage reports discover untested lines.
